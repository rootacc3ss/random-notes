If you stumbled upon this on GitHub, it was not meant for the general public (yet). I truly implore you to wait for the final version with research to come out before following this; for now, it should be disregarded.

Do not try this stack. If using any peptides or supplements, contact a doctor.

This is not medical advice. I am a passionate researcher, not a clinician.

**P.S.**

**I am aware of the formatting issues on this markdown document. I used AI to convert spreadsheet, text and research data, all in to one markdown file, and some errors occurred... i.e. section "Functional Coverage" is missing serotonin et al, etc. This will be fixed.**

# ‚úÖ End of Stack Guide; Disclaimers

Please, be careful, and prepare to taper off of much of what you are taking here.

I will soon include a taper guide and a list of what you can and should continue to take daily.

You may only need a round or two of peptides, maybe a cycle overtime. If you are not having severe effects of brain damage from drug abuse or traumas, do not take the full version of this stack. 

This stack was created for those suffering from what was previously mentioned and who need rigorous care and imminent repair. 

Once again, @keygen / rootacc3ss / HS (myself, the creator of this content) is NOT a doctor or formally trained healthcare provider.

‚ÄºÔ∏è CONSULT WITH A DOCTOR BEFORE TAKING ANYTHING, **ESPECIALLY** IF ON OTHER MEDICATION.

# Personal Notes

Don't worry about or consider these.

## Next Purchases / Tests

Next to purchase after running stack successfully:

~~Methylene Blue (energy for CFS among other benefits), start at 10mg w/ no more than 20-30 in a day. Put directly in to a cup of coffee for best results.~~
‚úÖ Purchased, not yet adding to stack until I know it's good. **SEE NOTE BELOW ABOUT THIS CHEMICAL**

~~NAD+ for testing~~ ‚úÖ Added, **Add both MBlue and NAD+ to core stack after testing.**

~~Noopept (just to have on hand or to use with Bromantane).~~ ‚úÖ Added, should have some on hand soon with dosage scoops.

TB4 after one month BPC. So, one month off of BPC after first cycle then cycle BPC+TB4 for another month.

SPG302 for mentions above. Already reached out to source on WhatsApp.

Bromantane for a quick boost, nasal spray preferred.

Test those in addition to current stack, then implement Cerebrolysin, FGL and Dihexa as needed. All of those are the next purchases to follow this list of purchases. 

Selank may be useful, as well. It is also taken nasally. I‚Äôm also curious about Semax.  

R-ALA for heavy metal detox; good to have on hand. 

Minifridge for supplements.

## Sources

RuPharma for various branded chemicals (Cerebrolysin)

apeiron.store for oral BPC/TB4 peptides and vitimins

Fandachem.com for SPG302

Amazon for most things including MBlue and Noopept. They have Nutricost, BulkSupplements, Nootropics Depot and more. 

Science.bio for bromantane and most noots

peptidesciences.com for peptides (there are a few other good sources, heard good about limitlesslifenootropics.com, biotechpeptides and corepeptides i need to research). 

Everychem for some noots/chems (Cosmic Nootropics is better)

---

## Subnotes

**DO NOT USE METHYLENE BLUE UNTIL OFF OF APs. RESEARCH IF IT CAN BE USED WITH THIS STACK. CHECK AND SEE IF IT INTERACTS WITH LITHIUM. SEROTONIN SYNDROME IS LIKELY.**

Maybe don't worry so much about the peptides and chems outside of BPC, TB4 and SPG as I may need to prune some synapses (autism lol).

Before adding anything from next purchases or anything outside of the primary stack, see how this one works for you.

Piracetam may be a good addition to bromantane, or low dose noopept. 

~~Forgot to buy Glycine. This Amazon et al. shipment(s) should include everything from the main stack minus glycine (which sucks but I don't want to drink a massive amount of that anyways right now).~~
Went back and got some. 

Latest shipments include everything minus the stuff I already have. Additionally, there is NAD+, Noopept and methylBlue. This shipment will not have TB4. I will list out everything once it all arrives on Saturday. 

Next orders should specifically be SPG and Bromantane (maybe semax and selank, the latter 3 are on science.bio). And, TB4/BPC. Of course, anything else is fine if it needs replinishment. Do NOT try the additional peptides and substances (like Dihexa, even if you buy from science.bio) until you've ran BPC with TB4. Look on favorites photo album for a list on sci.bio and a reminder for fanda. 

Grab some R-ALA for heavy metal detox. 

Visit doctor for low dose naltrexone for lupus and mental health ailments. 

Make "essential medications list" with propanolol and the likes. 

get on metformin

get approved science.bio and buy amino bone

add all new additions to stack (centralize all that you've bought and future chemicals after purchase in to main table, make new tables after this. ensure to get all purchases like SPG, and all the RuPharma/Science.bio/fandachem purchases in first.
